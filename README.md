# Social-Network-Analysis-of-Github-Users

Github is the most popular online code versioning system used by engineers, software developers, research scholars and students. The Github user base itself forms a social community. Github offers many features like code repositories, starring, forking and following. In this project we will utilize the Github API to access the Github Data and apply social network analysis techniques on the fetched data. We will be constructing graphs, finding influential users and perform community detection on the Github user data.
